# Polarization Image Fusion via Analytical Attention Heads
## Industry-Polarization-Dataset
We have constructed the Industry-Polarization-Dataset (IPD), a specular reflection & low-contrast polarization image dataset for industrial products, based on our self-developed polarization imaging system and commercial polarization cameras. IPD contains 416 sets of polarization images covering industrial products under various illumination conditions and imaging perspectives, with each set requiring no image registration. The dataset includes three types of polarization images: division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) polarization images, time-sequential linear polarization images, and time-sequential full polarization images. The DoFP polarization camera adopts Daheng Imaging's MER2-503-36U3M POL, which is built on Sony's IMX264 MZR CMOS polarization sensor chip, capable of simultaneously capturing 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° polarization images with a resolution of 2448×2048. The time-sequential polarization images are acquired using our self-developed polarization imaging system. This system consists of a camera, lens, and rotating drive mechanism. Linear polarization image sequences are obtained by rotating a linear polarizer, while full polarization image sequences are captured by fixing a linear polarizer in front of the lens and rotating a quarter-wave plate.
